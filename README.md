##Simple Ajax Image Load on "Action"

This project is to help people that are on limited bandwith.  It was originally inspired to share content with people that have throttled internet like those facist Canadians to our north.

The idea is simple, bootstrap setup to display the content, then jquery .ajax() call to request content based on user initiation.
